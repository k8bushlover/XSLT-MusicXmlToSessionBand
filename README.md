# MusicXmlToSessionBand   
use XSLT 1.0 to convert MusicXML files to SessionBand (Jazz) formats (beta)

Will need an XSLT interpreter or platform to launch the XSLT files.  One may or should be built into Windows (will add more notes as I delve into this again.  An open source XSLT 3.0 processor is available here: http://saxon.sourceforge.net.)

The only files I have tested with are MusicXML files as exported from iReal Pro app on iOS, circa mid-2015.

Will have to review and map out which worked best.  

In 'new' and 'v2' files, may have been working on trying to deal with repeats, codas, etc. 

The 'sbj', 'sbj2', 'sbj3'  designations refer to Session Band Jazz (1), 2 or 3

Not horribly organized, uploading all versions of files I've worked on to date (last worked on mid-2015), including a Java class I had somehow managed to learn how to create once upon a time. Thus my motivation to join github and get it straight, or at least out there.
