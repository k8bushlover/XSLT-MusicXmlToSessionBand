# MusicXmlToSessionBand   
use XSLT 1.0 to convert MusicXML files to SessionBand (Jazz) formats (beta)

The only files I have tested with are MusicXML files as exported from iReal Pro app on iOS, circa mid-2015.

Will need an XSLT interpreter or platform to launch the XSLT files.  One may or should be built into Windows (will add notes as I delve into this again.)

Not horribly organized, uploading all versions of files I've worked on to date (lag of 2+ years since last looked at or worked on), including a Java class I had somehow managed to learn how to create once upon a time. Thus my motivation to join github and get it straight, or at least out there.
